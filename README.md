# K2 Workflow REST API Sample project

This project demonstrates how to interact witht he K2 Workflwo REST API through a JSSP Service Type. 

# Features

  - Sample unit tests with mocks and code coverage.
  - RollupJS configuration for TypeScript.

## Getting Started

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12.14.1+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

See the documentation for [@k2oss/k2-broker-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@k2oss/k2-broker-core)
for more information about how to use the broker SDK package.

## Running Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, run:

```bash
npm test
```

You can also use a development build, for debugging and coverage gutters:

```bash
npm run test:dev
```

You will find the code coverage results in [coverage/index.html](./coverage/index.html).

## Building your bundled JS
When you're ready to build your broker, run the following command

```bash
npm run build
```

You will find the results in the [dist/index.js](./dist/index.js).

## Creating a service type
Once you have a bundled .js file, upload it to your repository (anonymously
